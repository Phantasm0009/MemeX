# ✅ Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified
The `/refresh` command was failing with the error:
```
TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object at Function.keys (<anonymous>)
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Backend Mismatch**: PM2 was running `backend/simple-server.js` instead of `backend/server.js`
2. **Response Format Difference**: 
   - Enhanced backend returns: `{ success: true, market: {...}, timestamp: ... }`
   - Simple backend returns: `{ success: true, message: "...", updatedStocks: 15, timestamp: ... }`
3. **API Client Issue**: `marketAPI.js` was only handling the enhanced backend format
4. **Price Update Interval**: Simple backend was still using 15-minute intervals instead of 5 minutes

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed MarketAPI Response Handling
- Updated `utils/marketAPI.js` to handle both backend response formats
- Added fallback logic for different response structures
- Improved error handling for API responses

### 2. Enhanced Refresh Command
- Updated `commands/refresh.js` to work with both response formats
- Added better error handling with detailed error information
- Improved display logic to show correct stock counts regardless of backend type

### 3. Updated Price Intervals
- Changed `backend/simple-server.js` from 15-minute to 5-minute price updates
- Ensured consistency across all backend implementations

### 4. Improved Error Reporting
- Added detailed error embeds with error type, message, and timestamp
- Better logging for debugging developer commands

## Testing Results
✅ `/refresh` command now works successfully
✅ 5-minute price updates active on backend
✅ Developer-only commands properly hidden from public
✅ Multiple developer support via environment variables
✅ Proper error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps
- The bot is ready for global deployment
- All security measures in place
- Developer commands working correctly
- Market updating every 5 minutes as requested
